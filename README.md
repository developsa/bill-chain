BillChain is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to streamline the bill payment process. Users can pay their bills directly through the DApp using XLM (Stellar Lumens) without needing to access banking applications or payment websites. Additionally, the DApp includes messaging features that enable users to manage transfer processes more efficiently.
